Overflows occur when a program does not properly check the size of the input they are receiving resulting in input being able to be larger than the where it is stored in, which can cause it to overflow into other parts of memory
# Variable buffer overflows
variable buffer overflows occur when the program takes input into a variable but does not validate the size, this allows them to overwrite other variables in the stack which can possible allow them to pass checks that they shouldn't have or print different things by overwriting memory addresses
## call functions
when you are allowed to pass a large enough value you can reach the return value, you can make it so that when the function returns it returns to a memory address of your choosing
