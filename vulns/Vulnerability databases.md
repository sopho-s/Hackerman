There are many different applications and services that have had many vulnerabilities that have affected them. Vulnerability databases store and note down these vulnerabilities
- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln)
- [Exploit-DB](http://exploit-db.com/)
- [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)
while NVD keeps track of vulnerabilities, it does not help when searching for vulnerabilities for a specific application or scenario
Exploit-DB is an excellent resource that helps you search for specific vulnerabilities that affect the application or service you are trying to attack
