# Broken access Control
Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors, if a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the access controls are broken
## Insecure Direct Object Reference
This refers to an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to see. this occurs when a programmer exposes a direct object reference, which is an identifier that refers to specific objects within the server
e.g. changing id in the url to point to a different id as it exposes a direct object reference through the id parameter in the url
# Cryptographic failure
A cryptographic failure refers to any vulnerability arising from the misuse of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information
# Injection
Injection occurs when the application interprets user-controlled input as command or parameters
## Command injection
Command injection occurs when server-side code in a web application makes a call to a function that interacts with the server's console directly. An injection web vulnerability allows an attacker to take advantage of that call to execute operating system commands arbitrarily on the server
# Insecure design
Insecure design refers to vulnerabilities which are inherent to the application's architecture. they are not vulnerabilities regarding bad implementations or configurations, but the idea behind the whole application (or a part of it) is flawed from the start
## Insecure password resets
This is the general term when password resets are easily exploitable to reset someones password to what the hacker wishes
# Security misconfiguration
Security misconfiguration occurs when security could have been appropriately configured but was not
## Debugging interfaces
A common security misconfiguration concerns the exposure of debugging features in production software, debugging features are often available in programming frameworks to allow the developers to access advanced functionality that is useful for debugging an application while its being developed. Attackers could abuse some of those functionalities if somehow, the developers forgot to disable them before publishing their applications
# Vulnerable and outdated components
This just means that components that are being used have a well-known vulnerability which you can use to easily gain an advantage on the system
# Software and Data integrity failures
When talking about integrity we refer to the capacity we have to ascertain that a piece of data remains unmodified
this would happen if when using an external script the developer does not check if the script is the same as what they are expecting
# Server side request forgery
this type of vulnerability occurs when an attacker can coerce a web application into sending requests on their behalf to arbitrary destinations while having control of the contents of the request itself
