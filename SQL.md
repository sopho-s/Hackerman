# Relational vs non-relational
## Relational database
stores structured data, meaning the data inserted into this database follows a structure. This structured data is stored in rows and columns in a table. Relationships can then be made between two or more tables
## Non-relational databases
unlike relational databases, data is stored in a non-tabular format, this means that the data can be of various quantities and types
## Which to choose
Relational databases are often used when data being stored is reliably going to be received in a consistent format, where accuracy is important
