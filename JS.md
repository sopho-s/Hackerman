in JS one can minify and obfuscate js code to make it non human readable but such that the browser can execute it correctly
an example of a website that can obfuscate js code is this [website](https://codebeautify.org/javascript-obfuscator)
a website that undoes this is [this](https://obf-io.deobfuscate.io/)
